# Quantum Generative Adversarial Network for Industrial Bioprocess Time Series Synthesis

## Abstract

We present a novel quantum generative adversarial network (QGAN) architecture for synthetic time series generation in industrial bioprocesses. The proposed method combines a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) generator with a classical discriminator, trained using the Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) framework. Our approach addresses the critical challenge of limited and proprietary bioprocess data by generating high-fidelity synthetic time series that preserve essential statistical properties including temporal correlations, volatility clustering, and leverage effects.

## 1. Introduction

Industrial bioprocesses generate complex time series data characterized by non-linear dynamics, temporal dependencies, and stochastic fluctuations. The scarcity of publicly available bioprocess data, combined with intellectual property constraints, creates significant barriers for machine learning applications in biotechnology. Quantum computing offers unique advantages for modeling complex probability distributions and capturing intricate correlations inherent in biological systems.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Problem Formulation

Let **x** = {x₁, x₂, ..., xₜ} represent a univariate time series of bioprocess measurements (e.g., optical density, pH, dissolved oxygen). Our objective is to learn a generative model G_θ that produces synthetic time series **x̃** indistinguishable from real data **x** according to a discriminator D_φ.

### 2.2 Quantum Generator Architecture

#### 2.2.1 Parameterized Quantum Circuit Design

The quantum generator employs a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) with N qubits and L layers:

```
|ψ(θ)⟩ = U_L(θ_L) ⊗ ... ⊗ U_2(θ_2) ⊗ U_1(θ_1) |0⟩^⊗N
```

Each layer U_l(θ_l) consists of:
1. **Noise encoding layer**: RY rotations with random input z ~ U[0, 2π]
2. **Parameterized rotations**: RX(φ) and RY(ψ) gates with trainable parameters
3. **Entanglement layer**: Circular CNOT connectivity pattern

#### 2.2.2 Measurement Strategy

The quantum state is measured using both Pauli-X and Pauli-Z observables:

```
G_quantum(z) = [⟨ψ(θ)|X_i|ψ(θ)⟩, ⟨ψ(θ)|Z_i|ψ(θ)⟩]_{i=1}^N
```

This yields 2N expectation values ∈ [-1, 1], providing enhanced expressivity compared to single-observable measurements.

#### 2.2.3 Classical Post-processing

The quantum measurements undergo classical transformation:

```
G(z) = MLP(G_quantum(z))
```

where MLP is a multi-layer perceptron that maps quantum outputs to the target time series domain.

### 2.3 Classical Discriminator

The discriminator D_φ is a deep neural network with the following architecture:

```
D_φ: ℝ^d → ℝ
```

- **Input layer**: Time series windows of length d
- **Hidden layers**: Dense layers with batch normalization and dropout (p=0.3)
- **Output layer**: Single scalar for Wasserstein distance estimation

### 2.4 Training Objective

We employ the Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) framework:

#### 2.4.1 Discriminator Loss

```
L_D = 𝔼[D(x̃)] - 𝔼[D(x)] + λ𝔼[(||∇_x̂ D(x̂)||₂ - 1)²]
```

where x̂ = εx + (1-ε)x̃ with ε ~ U[0,1], and λ = 10 is the gradient penalty coefficient.

#### 2.4.2 Generator Loss

```
L_G = -𝔼[D(G(z))]
```

#### 2.4.3 Optimization Protocol

- **Discriminator updates**: n_critic = 2 iterations per generator update
- **Optimizers**: Adam with β₁ = 0.5, β₂ = 0.9
- **Learning rates**: Adaptive scheduling based on loss convergence

### 2.5 Data Preprocessing

#### 2.5.1 Lambert W Transformation

To handle heavy-tailed distributions common in bioprocess data:

```
y = sign(x) × √(W(δ|x|^α))
```

where W is the Lambert W function, δ and α are fitted parameters.

#### 2.5.2 Normalization

```
x_norm = (x - μ) / σ
```

where μ and σ are empirical mean and standard deviation.

#### 2.5.3 Windowing

Time series are segmented into overlapping windows of length w with stride s:

```
X = {x_{t:t+w}}_{t=0,s,2s,...}
```

## 3. Evaluation Metrics

### 3.1 Distributional Similarity

**Earth Mover's Distance (EMD)**:
```
EMD(P, Q) = inf_{γ∈Π(P,Q)} 𝔼_{(x,y)~γ}[||x - y||]
```

### 3.2 Temporal Dependencies

**Autocorrelation Function RMSE**:
```
RMSE_ACF = √(1/L ∑_{l=1}^L (ρ_real(l) - ρ_synthetic(l))²)
```

### 3.3 Second-order Properties

**Volatility Clustering RMSE**:
```
RMSE_vol = √(1/L ∑_{l=1}^L (ACF_real(|r_t|²)(l) - ACF_synthetic(|r_t|²)(l))²)
```

**Leverage Effect RMSE**:
```
RMSE_lev = √(1/L ∑_{l=1}^L (Corr_real(r_t, |r_{t+l}|²) - Corr_synthetic(r_t, |r_{t+l}|²))²)
```
